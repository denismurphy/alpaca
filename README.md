# Alpaca: Tree of Thoughts Implementation

Alpaca is a implementation of the Tree of Thoughts (ToT) algorithm. It provides a framework for problem-solving tasks by leveraging large language models (LLMs) in a structured, tree-based search approach.

## Features

- 🌳 Tree of Thoughts (ToT) algorithm
- 🚀 FastAPI-based RESTful API
- 🔍 Supports both Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS)
- 🛠 Modular architecture for easy customization and extension
- 📊 Built-in state evaluation and thought generation
- 🔗 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Key Components

- Thought Decomposition Service
- Prompt Service
- Thought Generator Service
- State Evaluator Service
